            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As an ambitious and innovative bioengineer, I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Bioengineering,
                leveraging a strong foundation gained through my Bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado. My
                expertise lies in the intersection of medical devices, 3D modeling, AI, and user-centered design, with
                hands-on experience in cutting-edge research and real-world healthcare solutions.</p>
            <p>I’ve led and contributed to groundbreaking projects, such as developing a voice-activated medical bed
                that enhanced independence for a quadriplegic patient and designing synchronized sensor systems for
                wheelchair mobility tracking. These initiatives not only addressed technical challenges but also
                improved patient care and usability, showcasing my ability to deliver impactful, user-focused solutions.
                My experience navigating the complexities of regulatory compliance, COMIRB approval, and collaborative
                cross-functional environments speaks to my ability to execute projects from concept to completion.</p>
            <p>Known for my analytical thinking, project management expertise, and commitment to solving healthcare
                challenges, I thrive in fast-paced environments where innovation is key. I bring a global perspective,
                being fluent in English and proficient in French and Hindi, and a passion for advancing bioengineering
                to improve patient outcomes and push the boundaries of medical technology.</p>
            <p>With a commitment to continuous learning and a passion for improving lives through technology, I am
                excited to contribute to the future of bioengineering and medical innovation.</p>

        <section id="projects">
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Seat Savers Project</h3>
            <p>The team utilized a hybrid approach of Agile Scrum for iterative prototyping and Waterfall for FDA
                compliance to address infant vehicular death by hyperthermia. Initially, the objective was to create a
                new device to help parents avoid leaving children in vehicles.</p>
            <p>• Intellectual Property and Freedom to Operate (IP and FTO) survey revealed a saturated market, making
                further product development impractical.</p>
            <p>• The survey's conclusion emphasized the challenges of entering a densely packed space with existing
                patents and suggested shifting the focus. The project transitioned from product development to a
                usability study of existing aftermarket devices available to mid-income families. </p>
            <p>• Over 3 months, 5 devices were verified and validated, with expedited institutional review board
                approval secured for human subject testing.</p>
            <h3>MWU Mobility Tracking</h3>
            <p>Research focused on improving mobility data collection for manual wheelchair users by employing
                synchronized Apple Watches on both wheels. This approach aimed to capture comprehensive data on turning
                and swerving, often missed by single-sensor setups.</p>
            <p>• Developed a custom testing setup, including a motor, high-precision rotary encoder, and Arduino to
                ensure accurate data collection.</p>
            <p>• Successfully addressed challenges related to time synchronicity and hardware limitations, validating
                the setup for long-term use. Additionally, the research contributed to validating the Wheelchair Skills
                Test (WST) by integrating high-precision sensors with real-world wheelchair usage.</p>
            <h3>COMIRB Approval Application</h3>
            <p>• Successfully obtained COMIRB approval for human subject testing of wheelchair devices, gaining
                experience in navigating the institutional review board process and addressing safety concerns through
                extensive documentation and collaboration.</p>
